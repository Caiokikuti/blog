Nowadays, I am a eighth period Computer Science student in Universidade Estadual de Maringá. Around the second period that I was in college, I entered the PET-Informática (Tutorship and Mentoring Program) which is a Federal program that focuses on improving the teaching guidelines and developing leadership, communication abilities and team work. During my graduation I also took part in the academic representation as the president of the Computer Science academic center, my main duty as the president was representing all computer science students' interest in the university.  In my senior year of college, I started working in Eureka Labs (Maringá) as an intern and, at this time, the major part of my job was to develop WEB solutions focused on credit co-operatives. After 4 months of internship I was hired full time to keep developing WEB solutions in the same project I used to work on and that is where I stand today.
